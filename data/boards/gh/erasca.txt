Our Mission at Erasca is embedded in our name: To erase cancer.



Energized by recent scientific discoveries and advances in drugging various biological drivers of cancer, we are committed to solving oncology’s hardest problems. We have assembled a proven team and joined forces with world-class collaborators who embrace our ambitious goals.
In addition to our initial programs for undisclosed cancer targets, we seek to expand our pipeline through partnerships with academic scientists and biopharmaceutical companies who have revealed potential new mechanisms for precision oncology. Importantly, Erasca isn’t tied to one form of drug or any singular approach to treating cancer. By keeping an open mind about what is possible, we believe we will achieve the greatest results for patients everywhere.
Work Here
You’ve probably figured out by now that we’re passionate about what we do. Spend an hour with us, and you’ll feel the same sense of urgency that propels our work.
But you’ll also be quick to notice that we Erascals don’t take ourselves too seriously. Call us crazy, but we believe serious science can be serious fun.
Along with our casual, collaborative work environment, Erasca provides excellent compensation and benefits. Join us for the opportunity to help write the next chapter of oncology while working side-by-side with top scientists and management.
Because if we’re going to erase cancer, we need the very best. And Koosh balls. We definitely need Koosh balls.
Note to Staffing Agencies and Search FirmsPlease do not contact Erascals directly! We are a friendly bunch, but we do not accept unsolicited resumes from recruiters or search firms. We will not pay a fee for resumes or candidates submitted without an agreement in place. That said, we know the world runs on partnerships and would be happy to know more about you – to be considered for our approved vendor list, please send an email with a description of your firm and capabilities to jobs@erasca.com. We will read it. We promise.
